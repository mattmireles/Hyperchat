/// CrashDebugger.swift - Crash Debugging and Breadcrumb Logging
///
/// This file implements a lightweight crash debugging system that logs breadcrumbs
/// to help diagnose issues after crashes. It writes timestamped entries to a log
/// file for post-crash analysis.
///
/// Key responsibilities:
/// - Logs app lifecycle events (start/shutdown)
/// - Records window close operations
/// - Tracks WebView cleanup sequences
/// - Documents message handler removal
/// - Captures delegate callback timing
/// - Thread-safe file writing with barrier queue
///
/// Related files:
/// - `OverlayController.swift`: Logs window close events
/// - `ServiceManager.swift`: Logs WebView cleanup
/// - `WebViewFactory.swift`: May log handler cleanup
/// - `BrowserViewController.swift`: May log delegate callbacks
///
/// Architecture:
/// - Singleton pattern for global access
/// - Concurrent queue with barriers for thread safety
/// - File-based persistence in ~/Library/Logs/Hyperchat/
/// - Automatic file handle management

import Foundation
/// Singleton logger for crash debugging breadcrumbs.
///
/// Log file location:
/// ~/Library/Logs/Hyperchat/crash-breadcrumbs.log

/// The log persists between app launches to help
/// diagnose crashes that occurred in previous sessions.
