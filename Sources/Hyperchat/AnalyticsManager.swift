/// AnalyticsManager.swift - Amplitude Analytics Integration
///
/// This file manages analytics collection for Hyperchat using Amplitude.
/// It tracks user interactions to understand usage patterns and feature adoption.
///
/// Key responsibilities:
/// - Track prompt submissions with source attribution
/// - Monitor webview interactions and link clicks
/// - Respect user privacy preferences
/// - Batch events efficiently for performance
///
/// Related files:
/// - `SettingsManager.swift`: Manages analytics preferences
/// - `FloatingButtonManager.swift`: Reports floating button interactions
/// - `ServiceManager.swift`: Reports prompt submissions
/// - `BrowserViewController.swift`: Reports webview interactions

/// Privacy:
/// - Analytics enabled by default to help improve the product
/// - No personally identifiable information collected
/// - User can disable analytics at any time via settings
